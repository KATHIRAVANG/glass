    For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak
    only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge you are never
    alone.   Audrey

        I am the Associate Director of the Warehouse Workshop Screen Acting
        Studio, a fully owned subsidiary of McSweeney Newman Casting


        I have known Tegan Glass for around 2 years as a professional working
        agent in SE Queensland and have had a strong business relationship with
        Tegan for that period of time. In that time, Tegan ran her agency with a
        high level of professionalism, care, honesty and importantly, integrity.
        The welfare of her clients holds paramount importance, and she works
        tirelessly to develop careers, and to work efficiently, professionally
        and effectively with the industryâ€™s potential employers and key decision
        makers.

        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
        randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. 


        All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined
        chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
        Internet.
