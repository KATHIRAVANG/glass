  Last week’s blog was primarily based around Video ID’s. This week I will be
  talking about the next step to being successfully cast.


  **Self Tapes.**


  A lot of the time you will be asked to do a Self Tape, especially if the
  central casting takes place in a faraway place - such as Sydney from the Gold
  Coast, or even America.


  If you want to pursue an acting career, you most definitely will find yourself
  doing plenty of Self Tapes.


  Much like the Video ID, a Self Tape is rather simple.


  The casting director will send a brief to your agent, and along with the brief
  - a script for you to learn.


  It is _crucial_ that you learn your lines _**off by heart**_. Unlike America
  (where you can hold your script in hand in a Self Tape and Casting) it is
  _highly recommended_ here in Australia that you do not keep your script in
  hand.


  If you get the role, you will have to learn the lines off by heart anyway.


  _Why not learn them now?_


  Once you have learnt your lines, it is _vital_ that you have a proper place to
  film. Somewhere indoors is recommended, unless there is no wind or blotchy
  weather outside.


  Like the Video ID, you should film against a blank wall, or a simple looking
  surface (like a panelled wood wall, etc).


  The point is to have all the focus on _you_ and_ your acting_, rather than
  having a bright patterned wall to distract the audience watching.


  You also need to make sure that you can be heard. If you cannot be heard the
  Self Tape is useless and the casting director won’t even bother watching to
  the end.


  It is also _imperative_ that you film your Self Tape _horizontally_ and **not
  **vertically. There have been cases where the casting director clicked away
  and didn’t even bother watching a Self Tape because it was filmed incorrectly.


  The last thing you need to worry about is the steadiness of your camera. Try
  to keep it as steady as possible.


  _Thanks for reading!_


  **Stay tuned for next week’s blog as I will be talking about Dialect/Voice
  Performance and Coaching!**
