  On October 30th - 30 Glass kids came together to put on a show to raise money
  for Breast Cancer.


  Whilst guests enjoyed the delicacies from Greendays, they enjoyed the showcase
  from Sun Emporium. 30 gorgeous children of all ages rocked the runway in the
  latest Summer 2018 range.


  Huge thank you to everyone who attended on the day and made this such a
  special day to remember.
