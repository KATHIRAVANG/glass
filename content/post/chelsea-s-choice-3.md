  Recently I did something I had never done before - attend a seminar about
  business and self development.


  There are many different types of workshops, ranging from self-development
  training to business tips and tricks.


  I believe that attending training classes and/or discussions are one of the
  most important things you could be doing with your spare time, primarily as a
  model and actor.


  For both actors and models alike, it is essential to expand your horizon.
  Instead of sitting on my hands, waiting for an opportunity to come to me, I go
  catch opportunity myself!


  Go and enrol yourself into various classes - from personal development to
  acting classes!


  Having a vast expanse of skills heightens the chances of getting a job in both
  your modelling and/or acting career. Casting directors and clients often love
  it when you have a far-flung amount of skills!


  For example, a lot of models believe that the modelling and acting world are
  far apart, when in fact, they are inseparable. It isnâ€™t mandatory that a model
  can act, but it certainly helps when you know how to pose _and_ how to act
  when you go to a casting for a TVC _(television commercial)_!


  If you are looking for advice when it comes to business, or simply for
  inspiration - I recommend trying out ISR Training, a service supported by
  three sharks on the popular television show Shark Tank Australia.

  And if you want to up the ante for your career, I suggest checking out The
  Warehouse Workshop Acting Studio for the beginner, intermediate and expert
  classes on acting.

  And remember -


  Knowledge is not power.


  Knowledge is 'potential' power.


  ACTION is power.


  Life rewards ACTION.


  Take action and never miss an opportunity to expand your horizons!
