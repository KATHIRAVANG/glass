  As the year of 2018 comes to a close, I look back with fondness at the
  memories of the past year. Leaving behind a toxic environment, only to make
  our own amazing environment from the ground up.


  Reflecting back on the four months of creating Glass behind the scenes, I
  remember vividly brainstorming for the logo, and ideas for the website, as
  well as different opportunities for those who were to join in the coming
  months. The place we called an office for the first few months, buzzed with
  excitement and anticipation every time we entered it. We had a grinning dog
  greet us every time, he was our mascot -- Lewie, otherwise known as Lulu.


  The building excitement was almost too much to bear, as we waited anxiously
  for our website to go live on the 1st of June 2018. After months of slaving
  over our computers, to create and upload everyone's profiles, the relief was
  second to none as the website aired looking fabulous.


  Our thoughts then turned to our talent and wanting to welcome them to the
  Glass Family. We hosted a meet and greet at the Southport Yacht Club, and it
  went off without a hitch. It was a breath of fresh air, to finally meet so
  many new and incredible people, as well as picking up where we left off on the
  talent we already knew. I can say from personal experience, that seeing all of
  the children bouncing around, nearly gave me a heart attack -- they were all
  too adorable, and I fell in love at first sight.


  Once the website was live, and we had met all of our gorgeous talent... the
  phones wouldn't stop ringing, the emails wouldn't stop spamming us, and the
  clients practically knocked our doors down. The jobs coming in were almost
  like a tsunami, equally terrifying yet exciting.


  Our next step was to focus solely on our talent, and their talent. We started
  the first ever master classes. Where we would go on to teach, groups of
  beautiful children how to model, how to act, and how to be awesome. This was
  one of the highlights of my year, as I adored teaching so many youngens the
  skills that I had learnt as an actor and model over the years -- plus, they
  were all so cute.


  I loved watching so many of the tweens and teens evolve as the classes went
  on. I was so delighted and proud to see, that at the end of each term, their
  already existing talent skyrocketed, and that they all left with newfound
  friends.


  The next major thing that I can't help but bring up, was the raising of a
  thousand dollars for breast cancer funds. I was more than excited to raise the
  money, and spend my birthday surrounded by talented children and their awesome
  and giving parents, and grandparents. The catwalk event wouldn't have been
  possible, without the generosity and love from Sally at Sun Emporium -- who
  designed and supplied all of the lovely children swimwear for the event.


  We had but one thing left to do, to fully establish ourselves as a company.


  Have an office.


  We searched for months, looking for the perfect office space and environment
  for us, and our talent. Eventually, we found it. The Space GC is the perfect
  location to create and nurture lasting relationships with both our talent and
  clients.


  I remember seeing Tegan in her absolute element, once she was tasked in
  decorating our newly found office. She was on a mission and did it all in one
  day -- and even took the time to find me a little rose, of which I had
  requested weeks before and forgotten.


  So, as you can see, from my year -- I couldn't be happier and more fulfilled
  to be a part of the Glass Family.


  Everyone that surrounded me, my family, Tegan's family, and the talents family
  -- they all changed my life for the better.


  And I couldn't be more grateful.


  **Thanks,**\
