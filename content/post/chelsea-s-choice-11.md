  I believe we can all agree, that having an agency is rather important when it
  comes to getting the jobs you want, and/or need.


  But despite how important it is to have an agency - I've found that so many
  people simply: join, and wait.


  I am here to tell you now, that if you do that... chances are you're not
  getting any jobs.


  Here are a few tips to ensure that you get the most out of your agency, and
  your agency gets the most out of you!


  **Put in 100%**


  No agency is going to confidently send you in for castings if you're not
  active! Build your skills, expand on your skills, compile more photos, send
  them off to your agency!


  It's as simple as this: both you and your agency need to put in 100%. If you
  leave your agency with a few photos and expect them to get you a job, then
  you're sorely mistaken.


  **Always Check Emails**


  It is amazing how short notice some briefs can be. More often than not, your
  agent gets a brief and will have to respond within an hour! If they email you,
  in desperate need of information so that they can submit you, and you don't
  reply as fast as you can?


  You will lose the opportunity.


  **Training**


  Believe it or not, doing a single course on acting doesn't suddenly make you a
  good actor. And doing one modelling course doesn't suddenly make you a good
  model.


  I have found that so many people call themselves actors/models merely because
  they belong to an agency and/or did one course.


  It's almost exactly like saying you did one pilot training session, and now
  you're a pilot. It simply doesn't work that way.


  I am continually expanding my skills, and although I already have eleven years
  of acting under my belt, I still attend workshops and courses regarding
  acting. No matter how much experience you have, there is always going to be
  room for improvement. Modelling and acting alike.
