  Over time, the importance of knowledge has skyrocketed to unimaginable
  heights, and nowadays, if you wish to succeed at certain life goals knowledge
  plays a major role. And quite evidently, knowledge of the industry in the
  profession of acting is absolutely vital to whether or not you get that role.


  I've expressed a few times in these blogs that training is very important, not
  only to help yourself grow as a person — but to give you the knowledge and
  skills needed to succeed in this cut-throat industry.


  Despite my many years of experience when it comes to acting, having been
  acting since I was five-years-old, I still dedicate myself to various
  workshops, courses and private tutoring. The more you know, the more you
  learn, the more equipped you are to walk into that casting and _nail it._


  I've found that some people believe there is a limit to how aged you can be to
  succeed in this industry. Trust me when I say this — _you can never be too old
  to learn and score the next television commercial!_


  Whether or not you feel you are experienced in the art of acting, or scripts,
  or castings and auditions or self-tapes: it never hurts to go to the
  occasional workshop and brush up on your knowledge further. Even I, going on
  to my 13th year of acting, still have so much to learn and I firmly believe
  that I will still have much to learn in another thirteen years.


  To be frank with all of you eager to go into the audition room, excited to
  jump into the skin of a character and portray them on screen — you cannot
  simply join an agency and sit on your hands, waiting for your big break. Why
  join an agency and _not_ learn any skills to get the job?


  Do you join a Dancing Academy and expect to be able to perform on stage
  without attending the classes? Do you want to waste your time, effort and
  money driving up to Brisbane for a Casting, only to find that there are thirty
  other battle-hardened actors that have the knowledge you don't?


  Knowledge is vastly important, and to avail yourself of the knowledge of this
  industry will lead to more successful auditions and captured roles! And though
  I have been talking primarily about acting, the same goes for modelling.


  Good luck out there, and keep your eyes peeled for up and coming classes!


  _Thanks for reading,_


  _Chelsea._
