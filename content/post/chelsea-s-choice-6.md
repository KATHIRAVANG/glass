  Social Media is a significant part of our everyday culture, and as
  time-consuming, it can be - it does a lot when it comes to bolstering your
  internet influence.


  As actors and models, social media _(Instagram specifically)_ is immensely
  valuable. I have heard instances where an actor or model have secured a job
  purely because of their Instagram's.


  Instagram especially plays a prominent part in whether or not we get a job.
  More often then not, if you are considered for a job the casting director will
  go through your Instagram account. If they don’t like what they see, they
  won’t give you the job.


  Although for actors specifically, your Instagram plays a substantial role.
  Directors look for good actors, _yes_, but if they find your Instagram account
  is littered with revealing images, they won’t accept you. As every director
  wants their film to be represented appropriately.


  Their work would be tarnished if their main character had a sketchy Instagram
  account.


  Pay close attention to how your Instagram appears and represents you as a
  person and you shouldn't go wrong!


  _Stay tuned for the next few blogs as I will be expanding on this subject
  matter (social media) and talking about the dark side of Instagram, benefits
  of Instagram, Safety and how to get noticed._
