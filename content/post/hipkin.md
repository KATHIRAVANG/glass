  I had the pleasure to attend a shoot with the amazing Bec G last weekend. It
  was styled by the  boutique online store Hipkins.


  Hipkins is a super cool selection of fashion forward kid's clothing that have
  been hand picked  from around the globe. Every item you see online is there
  because they love it. And love it you will!


  Born in Melbourne, Hipkin makes finding that unique kids fashion clothing
  piece, outfit or entire wardrobe, easy and enjoyable. From the depths of New
  York Soho, to the corners of Scandinavia.


  Hipikin is now unisex and has boys only ranges too. Seen here pictured in last
  weeks shoot. 

   Sailor Jacket  and hat by Mini Rodini.
