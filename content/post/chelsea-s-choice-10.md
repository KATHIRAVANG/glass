  I found that, in this particular industry, a lot of people believe that both
  acting and modelling don’t go together.


  Many models that I have encountered have absolutely no interest in acting, or
  what it could bring to their metaphorical doorstep. And vise versa.


  And that, fellow readers, is what separates a good model from being a
  _phenomenal_ model. And a good actor, from being a _phenomenal_ actor.


  With both talents combined, acting and modelling, you could be the most
  expressive model - _who doesn’t want that?_


  And with good modelling skills, you could look _astounding_ in literally every
  shot/scene you are in. 


  ~_plus you can get good at lying with a straight face~_


  **But that’s beside the point.**


  Acting and modelling go hand in hand. And one without the other... _is wasted
  potential._


  Make the most of your profession and go the extra leap!


  Attend acting classes, attend modelling classes. Better your skills on both
  ends and become the best you can be!


  Throughout my minimal years, I have had a significant amount of experience in
  both fields. But I would be lying if I said I haven't done one more than the
  other.


  I have been modelling for a few years now, maybe three or four. But acting...
  I have been an actress for a total of 11 years, nearing onto 12 years.


  Ever since I was but a _wee child_ _of five_, I have been immersing myself
  into multiple, diverse acting genres.


  Counting 8 years of theatre training that includes improvisation, auditioning,
  puppetry, sports theatre, pantomime, and more, and I have been involved in
  numerous theatre productions.


  And on top of 8 years of theatre, I have done 4 years of intensive screen/tv
  training.


  Saying from experience, knowing how to both _model and act_, helps a lot.


  Although I don't expect anyone to have the number of years I have put in, and
  to have done clowning workshops, paper bunraku puppetry workshops and physical
  theatre...


  **But I do expect everyone to give it a crack! No harm no foul.**


  I advise all you models out there to attend acting classes, and all you actors
  out there to attend modelling classes. The more skills, _the merrier!_


  If you're looking for acting classes, I highly reccomend The Warehouse
  Workshop.


  If that is not to your taste, stay tuned!


  As along with another lovely lady, I will be teaching a beginners acting class
  on behalf of Glass Management.


  If you're looking for modelling classes, I recommend keeping an ear out for
  Glass news as we are also preparing to do another few Modelling courses.


  Thanks for reading!
